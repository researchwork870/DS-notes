# Gradient Boosting: Comprehensive Notes

## Intuition and Mathematical Foundations

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones. Unlike bagging methods (like Random Forest) that build independent models and average their predictions, boosting creates a series of dependent models where each one learns from the mistakes of its predecessors.

### Core Intuition
- Start with a simple model (often a decision tree with limited depth)
- Identify where this model makes errors
- Build a new model specifically to correct those errors
- Combine models in a weighted fashion

### Mathematical Framework

The gradient boosting algorithm aims to minimize a loss function by iteratively adding weak learners (typically decision trees) that follow the negative gradient of the loss function.

1. **Initialize** with a constant value:
   $F_0(x) = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, \gamma)$

   For squared error loss, this is simply the mean of target values.

2. **For** m = 1 to M (number of boosting iterations):
   - Compute pseudo-residuals (negative gradients):
     $r_{im} = -\left[\frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)}\right]_{F=F_{m-1}}$ for i = 1,...,n

   - Fit a base learner (regression tree) $h_m(x)$ to the pseudo-residuals
   
   - Compute multiplier $\gamma_m$ by solving:
     $\gamma_m = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \gamma h_m(x_i))$
   
   - Update the model:
     $F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \nu \cdot \gamma_m h_m(x)$
     
     where $\nu$ is the learning rate (shrinkage parameter)

3. **Output** final model: $F_M(x)$

### Loss Functions

The choice of loss function depends on the problem:

- **Regression**: 
  - L2 (squared error): $L(y, F) = \frac{1}{2}(y - F)^2$
  - L1 (absolute error): $L(y, F) = |y - F|$
  - Huber loss (robust to outliers): combines L1 and L2

- **Classification**:
  - Binary: Log loss (logistic): $L(y, F) = -y \log(p) - (1-y)\log(1-p)$ where $p = \frac{1}{1+e^{-F}}$
  - Multiclass: Cross-entropy loss

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm Steps (Theoretical)

1. **Initialize** the model with a constant prediction for all instances:
   - For regression: mean of target values
   - For classification: log-odds of the target class

2. **For each boosting iteration**:
   - Calculate pseudo-residuals (negative gradients of loss function)
   - Train a weak learner (typically a decision tree) on these residuals
   - Calculate optimal leaf values for the tree using line search
   - Apply shrinkage (learning rate) to the tree's predictions
   - Add the weighted tree to the ensemble
   - Update residuals based on new predictions

3. **Final prediction** is the sum of all tree predictions (with learning rate applied)

### Key Components in Implementation

#### 1. Base Learner Construction
Decision trees are typically used with restrictions:
- Limited depth (usually 3-8 levels)
- Minimum samples per leaf
- Split criteria: MSE for regression, Gini/entropy for classification

#### 2. Gradient Calculation
For different loss functions:
- Squared error: residual = y - prediction
- Log loss: residual = y - probability prediction
- Other loss functions have their own gradient formulations

#### 3. Shrinkage/Learning Rate
Applied to each tree's contribution to slow the learning process and improve generalization.

#### 4. Line Search for Optimal Leaf Values
For each leaf in the decision tree:
1. Group instances falling into that leaf
2. Find the optimal prediction value that minimizes the loss function for these instances
3. This requires solving an optimization problem (sometimes analytically, sometimes numerically)

#### 5. Tree Structure Optimization
For each potential split in the tree:
1. Calculate gain in loss function reduction
2. Choose split that maximizes this gain
3. Recursively continue until stopping criteria

## Key Hyperparameters

### Number of Estimators (n_estimators)
- **Definition**: Number of sequential trees to build
- **Impact**: More trees generally improve performance until diminishing returns or overfitting occurs
- **Tuning**: Start with a large number and use early stopping based on validation error

### Learning Rate (shrinkage)
- **Definition**: Weight applied to each tree's contribution (between 0 and 1)
- **Impact**: Lower values require more trees but often give better generalization
- **Tradeoff**: Learning rate and number of trees have an inverse relationship
- **Typical values**: 0.01-0.3

### Tree Parameters
1. **Max Depth**
   - **Definition**: Maximum depth of component trees
   - **Impact**: Controls complexity of individual models
   - **Typical values**: 3-8 (shallow trees work better for boosting)

2. **Min Samples Split/Leaf**
   - **Definition**: Minimum instances required to split node or create leaf
   - **Impact**: Prevents creation of nodes with too few samples, reducing overfitting
   - **Typical values**: Depends on dataset size (can be absolute or percentage)

3. **Max Features**
   - **Definition**: Subset of features to consider for splitting at each node
   - **Impact**: Introduces randomness, can improve generalization
   - **Typical values**: Square root or log2 of total features

### Subsampling Parameters
1. **Subsample (row sampling)**
   - **Definition**: Fraction of training instances used for each tree
   - **Impact**: Reduces variance, prevents overfitting, speeds up training
   - **Typical values**: 0.5-1.0
   - **Note**: When < 1.0, this is known as Stochastic Gradient Boosting

2. **Column Sampling**
   - **Definition**: Fraction of features used for each tree
   - **Impact**: Similar to max_features but applied at tree level
   - **Typical values**: 0.5-1.0

### Regularization Parameters
1. **L1/L2 Regularization**
   - **Definition**: Penalties on leaf weights to prevent extreme values
   - **Impact**: Reduces variance, prevents overfitting

2. **Min Split/Child Weight**
   - **Definition**: Minimum sum of instance weights needed in a child node
   - **Impact**: Controls complexity similar to min_samples but weighted
