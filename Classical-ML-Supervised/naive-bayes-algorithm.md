# Naive Bayes Algorithm: Comprehensive Notes

## 1. Intuition and Mathematical Foundations

### Basic Intuition
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features. Despite its simplicity, it often performs surprisingly well in real-world applications, particularly in text classification problems like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization.

The fundamental idea is to calculate the probability of a class given the observed features, and then select the class with the highest probability.

### Mathematical Foundations
Naive Bayes is derived from Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event:

$$P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \times P(C)}{P(X)}$$

Where:
- $P(C|X)$ is the posterior probability of class $C$ given features $X$
- $P(X|C)$ is the likelihood of features $X$ given class $C$
- $P(C)$ is the prior probability of class $C$
- $P(X)$ is the probability of features $X$

For classification, we want to find the class $C$ that maximizes $P(C|X)$:

$$\hat{C} = \arg\max_{c \in C} P(c|X)$$

Since $P(X)$ is constant for all classes, we can simplify:

$$\hat{C} = \arg\max_{c \in C} P(X|c) \times P(c)$$

The "naive" assumption comes into play when calculating $P(X|c)$. We assume that features are conditionally independent given the class:

$$P(X|c) = P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n|c) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|c)$$

This simplifies the computation dramatically, allowing the model to scale to high-dimensional data.

### Final Classification Rule
The final classification rule becomes:

$$\hat{C} = \arg\max_{c \in C} P(c) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|c)$$

To avoid numerical underflow with many multiplications of small probabilities, we often use log probabilities:

$$\hat{C} = \arg\max_{c \in C} \log P(c) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log P(x_i|c)$$

## 2. Types of Naive Bayes Models

Different Naive Bayes variants exist to handle different types of feature distributions:

### Gaussian Naive Bayes
Used for continuous features, assuming they follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

The likelihood of feature $x_i$ given class $c$ is:

$$P(x_i|c) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{c,i}^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x_i - \mu_{c,i})^2}{2\sigma_{c,i}^2}\right)$$

Where $\mu_{c,i}$ and $\sigma_{c,i}^2$ are the mean and variance of feature $i$ for class $c$.

### Multinomial Naive Bayes
Used for discrete features, typically representing counts (e.g., word frequencies in text).

The likelihood is modeled as a multinomial distribution:

$$P(X|c) = \frac{(\sum_i x_i)!}{\prod_i x_i!} \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{c,i}^{x_i}$$

Where $p_{c,i}$ is the probability of feature $i$ occurring in class $c$.

In practice, we typically use:

$$P(x_i|c) = \frac{count(x_i, c) + \alpha}{count(c) + \alpha \cdot |V|}$$

Where $\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter and $|V|$ is the size of the feature vocabulary.

### Bernoulli Naive Bayes
Used for binary features (0/1 values), such as presence/absence of words.

The likelihood is given by:

$$P(x_i|c) = p_{c,i}^{x_i} (1-p_{c,i})^{(1-x_i)}$$

Where $p_{c,i}$ is the probability that feature $i$ appears in samples of class $c$.

### Complement Naive Bayes
A variant of Multinomial Naive Bayes that estimates parameters using data from all classes except the target class. It works better for imbalanced datasets.

## 3. Implementation Details

### Training Phase

1. **Calculate Prior Probabilities**:
   - For each class $c$, compute $P(c) = \frac{N_c}{N}$
   - Where $N_c$ is the number of samples in class $c$, and $N$ is the total number of samples

2. **Calculate Likelihood Probabilities**:
   - For each feature $i$ and class $c$, compute $P(x_i|c)$ based on the chosen model:
     - Gaussian: Estimate $\mu_{c,i}$ and $\sigma_{c,i}^2$ from training data
     - Multinomial: Compute feature frequencies within each class
     - Bernoulli: Compute feature presence/absence frequencies within each class

3. **Handle Zero Probabilities** (Smoothing):
   - Apply Laplace (add-1) smoothing or more general additive smoothing to avoid zero probabilities
   - $P(x_i|c) = \frac{count(x_i, c) + \alpha}{count(c) + \alpha \cdot |V|}$
   - Where $\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter (typically 1 for Laplace smoothing)

### Prediction Phase

1. **Calculate Posterior Probability** for each class:
   - $P(c|X) \propto P(c) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|c)$
   - Or, using log probabilities: $\log P(c|X) \propto \log P(c) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log P(x_i|c)$

2. **Choose the class** with the highest posterior probability:
   - $\hat{C} = \arg\max_{c \in C} P(c|X)$

## 4. Key Hyperparameters

### Smoothing Parameter (α)
- **Purpose**: Prevents zero probabilities in likelihood estimation
- **Effect**: 
  - Small α: Model stays closer to observed data, may overfit
  - Large α: More smoothing, can help with sparse data but may underfit
- **Typical values**: 1.0 (Laplace smoothing), values between 0.001 and 1.0 are common
- **Tuning**: Cross-validation to find optimal value

### Variant Selection
- **Purpose**: Choose the appropriate distribution assumption for your data
- **Options**: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli, Complement
- **Selection criteria**: Data type and distribution characteristics

### Prior Probabilities
- Can be estimated from data (default) or manually specified
- **Custom priors**: Useful when dealing with class imbalance or incorporating domain knowledge

### Feature Selection
- While not a direct hyperparameter, feature selection significantly impacts performance
- **Methods**: Chi-square test, mutual information, or domain knowledge
- **Effect**: Reducing dimensionality, removing noise, improving computational efficiency

## 5. Computational Complexity

### Time Complexity

**Training**:
- O(n·d) where n is the number of training samples and d is the number of features
- The model only needs one pass through the data to calculate necessary statistics

**Prediction**:
- O(c·d) where c is the number of classes and d is the number of features
- For each class, we need to calculate the product of feature likelihoods

**Space Complexity**:
- O(c·d) where c is the number of classes and d is the number of features
- Stores parameters for each feature-class combination

## 6. Strengths and Weaknesses

4. **Probabilistic output**: Provides probability estimates, not just classifications
5. **Online learning**: Can be incrementally updated with new data
6. **Interpretability**: Model parameters have clear probabilistic interpretation

2. **AUC-ROC**: Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
3. **Brier Score**: Mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes

### Cross-Validation
- k-fold cross-validation is commonly used to evaluate Naive Bayes models
- Helps detect overfitting and provides more robust performance estimates

## 9. Implementation Considerations
