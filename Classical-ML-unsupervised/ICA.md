# Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

## 1. Intuition and Mathematical Foundations

### Intuition
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive, statistically independent components. Unlike PCA which finds uncorrelated components, ICA finds truly independent components. The classic motivating example is the "cocktail party problem" where multiple people are speaking simultaneously, and using recordings from multiple microphones, ICA can separate out individual voices.

The core idea is that:
- Mixed signals are combinations of independent source signals
- Independent sources have non-Gaussian distributions
- ICA aims to find a linear transformation that maximizes the statistical independence of the components

ICA assumes that observed signals X are a linear mixture of independent sources S:
X = AS, where A is the mixing matrix. The goal is to estimate both A and S using only the observed signals X.

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Statistical Independence
Two random variables are statistically independent if their joint probability density function equals the product of their marginal probability density functions:

$$p(s_1, s_2) = p(s_1) \cdot p(s_2)$$

This is stronger than uncorrelatedness, which only requires:

$$E[s_1 s_2] = E[s_1] \cdot E[s_2]$$

#### Non-Gaussianity
ICA leverages non-Gaussianity because:
- If sources are Gaussian, independence equals uncorrelatedness, making ICA indistinguishable from PCA
- The Central Limit Theorem states that mixtures of independent random variables tend toward Gaussian distributions
- Therefore, maximizing non-Gaussianity leads to independent components

#### Measures of Non-Gaussianity:
1. **Kurtosis**: Fourth-order cumulant, measuring "peakedness" of a distribution
   $$kurt(y) = E[y^4] - 3(E[y^2])^2$$

2. **Negentropy**: Based on information-theoretic entropy, approximated by:
   $$J(y) \approx \sum_i k_i [E[G_i(y)] - E[G_i(v)]]^2$$
   where v is a Gaussian variable with same variance as y, and G_i are non-quadratic functions

3. **Mutual Information**: Measures dependence between random variables:
   $$I(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) = \sum_i H(y_i) - H(y)$$
   where H is entropy

### Algorithm Implementation (Theoretical)

#### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Centering**: Subtract mean to make X zero-mean
   $$X_{centered} = X - E[X]$$

2. **Whitening**: Transform data to have identity covariance matrix
   $$X_{whitened} = ED^{-1/2}E^T X_{centered}$$
   where E is the eigenvector matrix and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of X

#### FastICA Algorithm (One of the most popular ICA algorithms)

1. **Initialize**: Choose random initial weight vector w with unit norm

2. **Iteration Step**:
   - Update w using a contrast function g (derivative of G used in negentropy):
     $$w^+ = E[X g(w^T X)] - E[g'(w^T X)]w$$
   - Normalize w:
     $$w = \frac{w^+}{||w^+||}$$

3. **Convergence**: Repeat step 2 until w converges

4. **Deflation**: To find multiple components, use Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization after each component is found:
   $$w_i = w_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (w_i^T w_j)w_j$$
   and then normalize again

5. **Parallel Extraction**: Alternatively, update all components simultaneously:
   $$W^+ = E[Xg(W^TX)^T] - E[g'(W^TX)]W$$
   $$W = (W^+W^{+T})^{-1/2}W^+$$ (symmetric orthogonalization)

6. **Reconstruction**: Estimate source signals as:
   $$S = WX$$

#### Common Contrast Functions
1. **Kurtosis-based**:
   $$g(u) = u^3$$

2. **Tanh-based**:
   $$g(u) = \tanh(a_1 u)$$

3. **Gaussian-based**:
   $$g(u) = u \exp(-u^2/2)$$

## 2. Key Hyperparameters
