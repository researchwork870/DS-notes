# KNN Anomaly Detection: Comprehensive Technical Notes

## 1. Intuition and Mathematical Foundations

### Core Intuition
KNN anomaly detection relies on a fundamental premise: normal data points exist in dense neighborhoods, while anomalies are located in sparse regions of the feature space. By examining the distance to neighboring points, we can identify outliers as those that are "far away" from their neighbors.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Distance Metrics
The foundation of KNN anomaly detection is the distance function. Common distance metrics include:

**Euclidean Distance (L2 norm):**
$$d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}$$

**Manhattan Distance (L1 norm):**
$$d(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|$$

**Minkowski Distance (Lp norm):**
$$d(x, y) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}$$

**Mahalanobis Distance:**
$$d(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - y)}$$
Where Σ is the covariance matrix of the feature space.

#### Anomaly Score Calculations

Several scoring methods can be derived using the nearest neighbors:

**1. K-distance:**
The distance to the k-th nearest neighbor. For a data point x:
$$\text{anomaly score}(x) = \text{distance to k-th nearest neighbor}$$

**2. Average K-distance:**
The average distance to the k nearest neighbors:
$$\text{anomaly score}(x) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k} \text{distance to i-th nearest neighbor}$$

**3. Relative Density (Local Outlier Factor approach):**
Compares the density around a point to the density around its neighbors:
$$\text{LOF}_k(x) = \frac{\sum_{y \in N_k(x)} \text{lrd}_k(y)}{\text{lrd}_k(x) \cdot |N_k(x)|}$$

Where:
- $N_k(x)$ represents the k-nearest neighbors of x
- $\text{lrd}_k(x)$ is the local reachability density

### Threshold Determination

After computing anomaly scores, we need a threshold to classify points:
- Points with scores above the threshold are anomalies
- Points with scores below the threshold are normal

Threshold selection methods:
1. **Statistical approach**: Set threshold at μ + nσ (mean plus n standard deviations)
2. **Percentile-based**: Use the pth percentile of scores (e.g., 95th or 99th)
3. **Domain knowledge**: Set based on specific application requirements
4. **ROC curve analysis**: Optimize based on false positive/negative trade-offs

## 2. Implementation Details

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Normalize/standardize features to prevent dominance by high-magnitude features
   - Handle missing values through imputation or removal
   - Optionally perform dimensionality reduction

2. **K Selection:**
   - Choose the number of neighbors to consider (the k parameter)
   - Small k: sensitive to local structure but noisy
   - Large k: more stable but may miss local patterns

3. **Build Nearest Neighbor Index:**
   - For efficiency, use spatial indexing structures:
     - KD-trees (effective for low-dimensional data, under ~20 dimensions)
     - Ball trees (better for higher dimensions)
     - LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) for approximate nearest neighbors in very high dimensions

4. **Compute Anomaly Scores:**
   - For each data point:
     - Find its k nearest neighbors
     - Calculate the anomaly score using the chosen method (k-distance, average k-distance, LOF, etc.)

5. **Classify Anomalies:**
   - Apply threshold to the scores
   - Flag points that exceed the threshold as anomalies

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Training (building index): O(n log n) with tree-based methods, where n is the number of training samples
  - Prediction (per sample): O(log n) for tree-based methods with low dimensions
  - For high dimensions: approaches O(n) as the curse of dimensionality takes effect

- **Space Complexity:**
  - O(n·d) where n is the number of samples and d is the number of dimensions
  - Additional overhead for index structures

### Variants and Enhancements

1. **Weighted KNN Anomaly Detection:**
   - Weight neighbors by their distance (closer neighbors have more influence)
   - Anomaly score becomes weighted average of distances

2. **Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD):**
   - Consider angles between pairs of neighbors rather than just distances
   - More robust in high-dimensional spaces

3. **ODIN (Outlier Detection using In-degree Number):**
   - Use directed graphs where each point connects to its k nearest neighbors
   - Anomaly score is the in-degree of each node

4. **Efficient KNN:**
   - Approximate nearest neighbor methods
   - Batch processing
   - Parallelization

## 3. Key Hyperparameters

### Number of Neighbors (k)

- **Effect:** Controls the locality of the anomaly detection
- **Low k:**
  - Advantages: High sensitivity to local outliers, better detection of small anomaly clusters
  - Disadvantages: High variance, susceptible to noise
- **High k:**
  - Advantages: More stable, robust to noise
  - Disadvantages: May miss local anomalies, computationally more expensive
- **Selection methods:**
  - Cross-validation with anomaly detection metrics
  - Domain knowledge about expected anomaly frequency
  - Rule of thumb: k = sqrt(n) where n is the dataset size

### Distance Metric

- **Effect:** Defines how similarity between points is measured
- **Selection considerations:**
  - Euclidean: Good for continuous features with similar scales
  - Manhattan: Better when features have different meanings or scales
  - Mahalanobis: Accounts for feature correlations, good for multivariate anomalies
  - Cosine: Useful when direction rather than magnitude matters
- **Domain-specific metrics:**
  - Time series: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
  - Text data: Edit distance or embedding-based metrics
  - Categorical data: Hamming distance

### Anomaly Score Method

- **Effect:** Determines how neighbor distances are converted to anomaly scores
- **Selection considerations:**
  - K-distance: Simple, efficient, but only considers one neighbor
  - Average K-distance: More stable, considers all k neighbors
  - LOF: Better for varying-density datasets, but computationally more expensive

### Threshold

- **Effect:** Controls the anomaly detection rate and false positive/negative trade-off
- **Selection considerations:**
  - Statistical methods work well for approximately normal distributions of scores
  - Percentile-based methods are robust to score distribution
  - ROC-based methods optimize for specific performance metrics

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

### Classification-Based Metrics

When labeled anomaly data is available:

1. **Precision:** Proportion of detected anomalies that are true anomalies
   $$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}$$

2. **Recall (Sensitivity):** Proportion of true anomalies that are detected
   $$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$$

3. **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   $$\text{F1} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$

4. **AUC-ROC:** Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
   - Measures performance across all possible thresholds
   - Robust to class imbalance

5. **AUC-PR:** Area under the Precision-Recall curve
   - More informative than ROC for highly imbalanced datasets

### Ranking-Based Metrics

When evaluating the quality of anomaly scores:

1. **Average Precision (AP):**
   - Average precision value for recall values over 0 to 1
   - Higher values indicate better ranking of anomalies

2. **Mean Average Precision at k (MAP@k):**
   - Average precision considering only the top k ranked points

3. **DCG (Discounted Cumulative Gain):**
   - Measures the usefulness of ranked results
   - Higher penalties for anomalies ranked lower

### Unsupervised Evaluation

When no labeled data is available:

1. **Silhouette score:** Measures how well anomalies are separated from normal points
2. **Density-based metrics:** Compare the density around detected anomalies vs. normal points
3. **Stability analysis:** How consistently the same points are identified as anomalies with:
   - Different parameter settings
   - Different subsets of the data
   - Different random initializations

### Application-Specific Metrics

1. **Time-to-detection:** How quickly anomalies are identified in streaming data
2. **Explanation quality:** How well the system explains why a point is anomalous
3. **Resource utilization:** CPU, memory, and time requirements
4. **Business impact metrics:** Financial savings, prevented failures, etc.

## 6. Practical Considerations and Best Practices
